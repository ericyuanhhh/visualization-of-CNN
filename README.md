# visualization-of-CNN
This is a project for my UROP1100(undergraduate research opportunity programme) in HKUST. The topics is neural dynamics. In this project,
a CNN with 5 convolutional layer and 3 fully connected layers trained with cifar10 dataset is used to repeat the results of visualizations
of CNN. I use the toolkit provided by https://github.com/raghakot/keras-vis. The author provide a good tool to help me to understand the 
mechanism of CNN.
